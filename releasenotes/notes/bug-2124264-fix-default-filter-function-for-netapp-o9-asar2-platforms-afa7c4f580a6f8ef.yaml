    NetApp driver `bug #2125054
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2125054>`_: Fixed
    default_filter_fucntion for NetApp driver to maintain the
    consistency across different platforms like ONTAP9 and ASAr2.

    Admin can add a custom filter to impose the total_volumes limit
    for ONTAP backends like below.
    filter_function=capabilities.total_volumes < <max_volumes_admin_wants>

    Note: The admin needs to configure the scheduler_default_filters to include
    the DriverFilter as well under [DEFAULT] stanza as part of cinder.conf,
    please refer [1] for the default filter list.
